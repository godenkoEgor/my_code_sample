# My code sample

Here are some examples of my code in C++ and Python. <br />

**C++:** <br />

1. File "merge_sequences.cpp". Implementation of the function which merges *n* sorted arrays of integer numbers into one array. The length of each array is *m*. Complexity of algorithm is *O(nmlog(n))*, memory usage is *O(mn)*. <br />

2. File "fixed_set.h". Implementation of storage for integer numbers. Complexity of initializing is *O(n)*, memory usage is *O(n)*, complexity of lookup is *O(1)*, where *n* is the quantity of integer numbers in the storage. <br />

3. File "grid_polarity.h". This is one of the header files from my Monte-Carlo project for simulation of the interstellar dust trajectories. This file contains interface of the polarity grid for the calculation of magnetic field polarity in the inner heliosheath. The explanatory comments for methods and functions are in the file. <br />

**Python:** <br />

1. File "MapPlotter.py". Script for plotting 2D map distribution. See documentation for details. <br />

2. File "lru_cache.py". Implementation of Least Recently Used (LRU) cache in Python. <br />
