# My code sample

Here are some examples of my code in C++ and Python. <br />


C++: <br />

1. Filename "merge_sequences.cpp". Implementation of function which merges *n* sorted array of integer numbers into one array. The length of each array is *m*. Complexity of algorithm is *O(nmlog(n))*, memory usage is *O(mn)*. <br />

2. Filename "fixed_set.h". Implementation of storage for integer numbers. Complexity of initializing is *O(n)*, memory usage is *O(n)*, complexity of lookup is *O(1)*, where *n* is the quantity of integer numbers in the storage. <br />
